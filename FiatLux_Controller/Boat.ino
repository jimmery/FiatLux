// setup. 
// take ambient light and store it. 


// continue taking in light values. 
// subtract ambient light. 
// experiment with one of these two methods: 
// 1. we can start transmitting RF when detecting a significant change in delta. 
   // we will have to define significant. 
// 2. we do analysis on first two detections to determine an approximate HIGH value and range. 
   // transmit when next HIGH value is detected (within a range). 


// we can consider doing a time delay here, depending on what we decide to do with the lighthouse. 


// when receiving a much higher value (for the laser), transmit a signal to stop the lighthouse.
